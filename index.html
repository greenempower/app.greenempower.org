		<h1>App of The Green Empower Organization</h1>

		<p>This will be the home of our cross platform app. It will serve as a common place to access our services.</p>

		<p>Our app may serve a few functions.</p>
		<p>Making a native app provides us capabilities we don't have just using the browser (although we shoulf fall back to the browser if needed).</p>
		<p>We can set up our own desired environment on the devices we are targeting. Including virtualization. We have greater power and control.</p>
		<p>We can implement our own markets including an app market.</p>

		<p>(More to come and I suspect that more use cases will emerge)</p>
